# Amazon-Clone-Website-with-CSS
This repository contains the source code for a simplified Amazon clone website. The goal of this project is to showcase my front-end development skills, specifically focusing on the use of CSS for styling and layout. While this is a clone, it's important to note that it's for educational purposes only and not intended for commercial use.

# Features
Responsive design: Ensure a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
CSS Flexbox and Grid: Utilize modern CSS layout techniques for a clean and organized structure.
Stylish UI: Mimic the look and feel of the Amazon website with carefully crafted styles.
